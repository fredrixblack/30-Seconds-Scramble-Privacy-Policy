# Privacy Policy for 30 Seconds Scramble

Last updated: 09/09/2024
## Introduction

Fredrix Black ("we" or "us" or "our") respects the privacy of our users ("user" or "you"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application 30 Seconds Scramble (the "Application"). Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the Application.

## Information We Collect

### Audio Recording

Our Application requires access to your device's microphone and may record audio. This permission is used for gameplay purposes, specifically to enable voice recognition for word input during the game. We collect and process this audio data to provide and improve our services.

It's important to note that:
- Audio recordings are processed in real-time and are not stored permanently.
- Audio data is used solely for the purpose of gameplay and is not shared with third parties.
- Audio processing occurs locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.

### Other Data

We do not collect any personal information or other types of data beyond the audio recording used for gameplay.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the audio data we collect solely to:

1. Enable voice recognition for gameplay purposes.
2. Improve the accuracy and performance of our voice recognition feature.

## Data Storage and Security

As the audio data is processed in real-time and not stored, we do not retain any of your audio recordings. The temporary audio data used for voice recognition is automatically discarded after processing.

## Third-Party Services

Our Application does not use any third-party services that would access or process your audio data.

## Your Data Protection Rights

Given the nature of our app and the way we handle data (real-time processing without storage), many typical data protection rights (such as the right to access or erase data) may not apply. However, you can always:

1. Choose not to use the voice recognition feature.
2. Revoke the microphone permission for our app through your device settings.

If you have any concerns or questions about your data, please contact us at fredrixblack@gmail.com.

## Children's Privacy

Our Application does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.
